# A component using redux and ag-grid

- accept a json as schema definition for "colDef"

    the shape of the schema is compatible with [the form component](https://github.com:buhichan/redux-schema-form) I use.
     
- use immutable.js and redux to store data

- provide a useful resource class to wrap a restful resource.
